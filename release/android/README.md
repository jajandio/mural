# Android release package

The default release specification tracks **version 13**, the planned paid Play production build. Version 12 is reserved for a separate Play-installed internal sandbox test and must never be promoted to production. Clean v13 builds keep paid purchases disabled; the paid build must explicitly enable Google Play purchases in the live environment. The signed v11 Play candidate was uploaded to internal testing before the latest fixes and remains a historical test artifact. The separately signed direct-distribution configuration uses Stripe.

The **version 4 guest preview for adults 18+** was published on Play on 26 September 2026, with paid checkout disabled. Its [submission record](evidence/play-submission-2026-09-14.json) and v4 test results describe that preview. Signed versions 12 and 13 were built and validated on 29 September. Version 12 replaced version 11 in internal testing; the production release remains gated on the Play-installed license test and matching backend activation. See [candidate scopes](candidate-scopes.md) before validating or distributing a build.

The owner-approved permanent package is `chat.mural.android`. Play registration and signing are separate release steps. `versionCode` starts at 1; each later upload must use a higher value. A debug installation is not a Play-signed release.

## Assets

The 512-pixel Play icon, native feature graphic and eight 1080 × 1920 screenshots are prepared. [Asset provenance and refresh instructions](assets/README.md) identify the inspected capture build and synthetic learning fixtures. The screenshots show English controls and learning in Spanish, Mandarin and Italian. Compare them with the final uploaded candidate after source changes. The icon's encoding was normalized to opaque RGBA without changing any RGB pixel, and its sRGB setting matches the canonical iOS source.

The eight screens cover conversation, word meaning, Mandarin with pinyin, themes, vocabulary, conversation history, Italian and language selection. Payment offers and personal account details are absent. Use the isolated capture workflow to refresh them. The older [design captures](../../verification/android-design/README.md) remain review evidence; their 1080 × 2424 dimensions exceed Play's maximum screenshot ratio.

The store icon must be a 512 × 512, 32-bit sRGB PNG, at most 1024 KB. [Google’s icon specification](https://developer.android.com/distribute/google-play/resources/icon-design-specifications) The feature graphic must be a 1024 × 500, 24-bit PNG without alpha. This repository's validator also requires opaque 24-bit PNG screenshots, between 320 and 3840 pixels on each side, with the longer side no more than twice the shorter. Play accepts JPEG screenshots too; this workflow uses PNG to make review consistent. Keep the Mural artwork intact, with no price, rating or award claims.

The iOS `AppIcon.appiconset/MuralIcon.png` is the canonical launcher artwork. Android must use the identical image bytes. The validator checks both images and follows the iOS catalog, Android manifest and adaptive foreground references so a resource change cannot silently select different artwork. It records the current iOS and Android design-source hashes for visual review. The current Android adaptive foreground has a 10% inset; identical source bytes alone do not prove the same visible scale after a launcher's mask is applied.

Derive the 512-pixel Play icon from the canonical image without redrawing, recoloring or substituting another orb. Use the same approved Mural mark in the feature graphic. Compare the installed launcher, in-app wordmark and final listing artwork with iOS before upload. Android's current wordmark uses Nunito; iOS uses its system rounded font, so their letterforms still need an explicit parity review. Store format checks do not establish brand parity.

The copy checker enforces Play's 30-character name, 80-character short description and 4,000-character full description limits. Release notes use a conservative 500-character limit. It also rejects unfinished placeholders. A passing check does not establish that the wording matches an untested feature.
