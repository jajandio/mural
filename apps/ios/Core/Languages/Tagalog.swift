        speechGuidance: "Use clear, natural everyday Tagalog as spoken in the Philippines, with natural stress, vowel length, glottal stops and conversational intonation. Tagalog is not a lexical-tone language; do not invent tone labels or grade pronunciation from written accent marks. Filipino is a learner-facing name for this teaching option; do not switch to another Philippine language. Use po and opo, and polite kayo, when the relationship and situation call for respect; do not force formal address between friends. Accept valid regional Tagalog and established loanwords without treating them as errors. Welcome English or mixed learner replies as support and bridge back to a useful Tagalog phrase, while keeping your own speech in Tagalog. Do not imitate a regional caricature or infer stress, glottal-stop or other pronunciation errors from a transcript alone.",
        writingGuidance: "Use contemporary Latin-script Tagalog with natural conversational wording. Use ordinary spelling in replies; preserve any learner-supplied diacritics, apostrophes and hyphens in quotations. Keep meaningful distinctions such as ng and nang, linkers na and -ng, and reduplicated forms such as araw-araw. Accept common conversational contractions without automatically calling them wrong. Do not append English translations, pronunciation guides or Baybayin to ordinary replies.",
        lemmaGuidance: "Use a consistent Tagalog dictionary citation form: nouns without ang, ng, sa or a plural marker, and verbs in their neutral/infinitive form with the voice/focus affix retained. For example, group kumakain and kakain under kumain, but kinain and kinakain under the separate lemma kainin; do not reduce both to the root kain. Keep useful chunks intact and preserve lexical hyphens. Use ordinary unaccented citation spelling consistently unless a diacritic is needed to distinguish a lexical meaning; keep distinct English senses separate. Preserve the observed form and exact quotation, including any diacritics. In mixed replies, include only identifiable Tagalog words or established loanwords used in Tagalog context; omit ambiguous or English-only evidence rather than labeling it tl.",
