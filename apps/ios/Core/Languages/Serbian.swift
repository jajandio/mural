        greeting: "Zdravo!", greetingWord: "zdravo",
        speechGuidance: "Use clear, natural Standard Serbian pronunciation as spoken in Serbia, with ekavian forms such as mleko, lepo and dete. Use ti for friendly conversation and Vi when the situation calls for formality. Model standard pitch accents, word stress, vowel length, syllabic r and the sounds č, ć, dž, đ, š and ž naturally. Accept valid regional accents, ijekavian forms such as mlijeko and dijete, and regional vocabulary without treating them or a non-native accent alone as an error. Do not infer a pronunciation error from spelling alone, including č and ć or dž and đ written the wrong way in a transcript.",
        writingGuidance: "Write Serbian only in the Latin script, never Cyrillic, with the standard letters č, ć, dž, đ, š and ž and ekavian spelling. Accept learner text in Cyrillic, in ijekavian spelling or typed without diacritics as valid input; you may model the standard Latin ekavian form, but never treat the script, ijekavian spelling or missing diacritics in a casual typed reply as a language error. Use standard punctuation and match the register to the situation.",
        lemmaGuidance: "Give nouns in the nominative singular, adjectives in the masculine nominative singular and verbs in the infinitive, in the Latin script with ekavian spelling, for example kuća, lep and pisati. Keep the exact observed form and quote unchanged, including Cyrillic, ijekavian or undiacritized input. Keep aspect pairs such as pisati and napisati distinct, keep se with reflexive verbs such as smejati se, and preserve meaningful chunks such as hvala lepo and nema problema.",
