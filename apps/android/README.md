# Mural for Android

Native Kotlin and Jetpack Compose client for Android 8.0 or later. It offers voice and written conversation, eleven learning languages, 24 themes, meanings, vocabulary and local history, using the owner's OpenAI API key. Mandarin captions link each word and show optional pinyin on Android 10 or later; Android 8 and 9 keep word links without pinyin.

Word taps in all eleven languages open a contextual meaning sheet, matching the iOS flow. Mandarin uses a bundled offline phrase dictionary with an ICU fallback; unresolved common ambiguous readings retain their source characters.

Interface copy lives in `res/values` (English) and `res/values-es` (Spanish); Android picks the translation from the phone's language.

See [install and build](../../docs/run-on-android.md), [design](../../docs/android/design.md) and [verification](../../verification/android-validation.md).

```sh
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug :app:assembleDebug
```

Requirements: Java 17, Android SDK 36 and Build Tools 35.0.0. The API key is entered inside the app and must never be configured in Gradle. `local.properties`, private signing keys and build outputs are excluded from Git.
